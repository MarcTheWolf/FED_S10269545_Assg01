## Features
### Existing
- <h3><u>CSS Animated Preloader</u></h3>
   
    - **<h4>Why?</h4>**
      - A preloader improves user experience by providing a visual indication that a webpage is loading, which helps prevent users from thinking the page is broken. This is especially important when the page consists of many components.

     - **<h4>How was it done?</h4>**
       - Using CSS attributes to create shapes and movement
       - "No-scroll" class added to body limited the user's viewport to only the Preloader page. 
       - Other elements will not show without the "visible" tag
       - On load, javascript retrieves the coresponding elements that needs to be showed and applies the related classes to them.

- <h3><u>CSS Animated Navigations Bar</u></h3>

    - **<h4>Why?</h4>**
      - Animated navigation bars can make a website feel more interactive and dynamic. Smooth animations catch the userâ€™s attention and make the navigation process more engaging.

      - Animations give users immediate visual feedback. For example, a hover effect on navigation links can make it clear to users that they are interacting with an element, which helps in making the interface more intuitive.
